## The answer, first

> **The asymptotic sieve for primes, as stated, cannot be applied to x² + 1.
> The hypothesis that fails is the Type I one, (R1).**
>
> [ASP] requires a level of distribution **D > x^{2/3}** — hypothesis (R1),
> p. 1043. [Note B](note-B-type-I.md) proves that for this sequence
> Σ_{d≤D}|r_d| ≍ D, so (R) forces D ≤ A(x) = x^{1/2}. Since
> x^{1/2} < x^{2/3}, **the admissible range for D is empty.**
>
> Read the next section before drawing conclusions from this. Heath-Brown hit
> the same wall at α = 2/3 and routed around it, so (R1) is the negotiable
> hypothesis — the durable obstruction is Type II.

Friedlander and Iwaniec state the general principle themselves, p. 1044:

> "for thin sequences A one cannot expect (R) to hold with D(x) > A(x) and for
> such sequences the classical sieve does correspondingly worse."

Combining that ceiling with (R1) gives the sieve's own **density threshold**:
it applies only to sequences with **A(x) > x^{2/3}**. This is stated outright
in [ASP] p. 1059, in the remark on hypothesis (9.2):

> "The condition (9.2) holds for sequences A = (aₙ) satisfying aₙ ≤ nᵋ and
> A(x) ≥ x^{2/3 + 2ε}."

| sequence | A(x) | vs. x^{2/3} | D achieved |
|---|---|---|---|
| a² + b⁴ | x^{3/4} | **above** | **x^{3/4−5ε}** ([X2Y4] Prop. 3.5, p. 962) |
| x³ + 2y³ | x^{2/3} | at the boundary | — **[VERIFY]** |
| x² + 1 | **x^{1/2}** | **below** | ≤ x^{1/2}, and no D is admissible |

So Step 2 as framed by the plan is attacking the wrong half. See
[§ Consequences](#consequences-for-the-plan) below.

## Heath-Brown's precedent — and what it does to the conclusion above

**This section revises the reading of the finding, not the finding.** (R1) is
genuinely unsatisfiable for x² + 1. But [HB] shows that (R1) failing is not, by
itself, fatal — it has happened before and was worked around.

### Heath-Brown uses the same density exponent

[HB] p. 2 defines α(f) as the infimum of α with
#{(x₁,…,xₙ) ∈ ℕⁿ : |f|(x₁,…,xₙ) ≤ X} ≪ X^α, and remarks:

> "Thus the smaller the value of α, the harder it will be to prove that f
> represents primes. The two classical theorems of Dirichlet both correspond to
> α = 1. … Before the present work there was only one theorem proved in which
> α < 1, namely the result of Friedlander and Iwaniec that there are infinitely
> many primes of the form x² + y⁴, for which α = 3/4. Our theorem corresponds
> to the still smaller value α = 2/3, **while the conjecture that x² + 1 takes
> infinitely many prime values has α = 1/2.**"

So the 1 / ¾ / ⅔ / ½ hierarchy this repo has been using is the literature's own
frame, and x² + 1 is named in it. α(f) is A(x)'s exponent — the same quantity.

### He did not use the asymptotic sieve, and said why

[HB] p. 3:

> "We should mention at the outset that our approach to the sieve procedure has
> much in common with that given by Friedlander and Iwaniec [3]. … **Unfortunately
> their condition (R1) is not quite met in our case, so that their work cannot be
> used as it stands. Although it seems possible that Friedlander and Iwaniec's
> hypothesis (R1) might be relaxed sufficiently for our application, we have
> chosen instead to present our own version of the sieve argument.** In the light
> of these remarks, it should be stressed that it is the 'Type II' bound … which
> is the most novel part of our proof, and not the sieve procedure."

Two things follow.

1. **The mechanism this note identified is confirmed from outside.** [HB]
   Lemmas 2.1–2.2 give A the level of distribution **X^{2−ε}** (p. 5) for a
   sequence whose values are ≍ X³. In the sieve's variable that is
   D = x^{2/3−ε}, against (R1)'s requirement D > x^{2/3}. **Missed by ε** —
   exactly "not quite met", and exactly the D ≤ A(x) ceiling biting at α = 2/3
   where A(x) = x^{2/3}. Note C's prediction that x³+2y³ sits "at the boundary"
   was right, and the [VERIFY] on it is discharged.
2. **(R1) is a soft barrier.** A leading practitioner, facing it, judged it
   probably relaxable and routed around it in a page. It is a feature of FI's
   particular formulation, not a law.

### But x² + 1 misses by a power, not an epsilon

| sequence | α | A(x) | level achieved | (R1) needs D > x^{2/3} | shortfall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| a² + b⁴ | 3/4 | x^{3/4} | x^{3/4−5ε} | ✅ met | — |
| x³ + 2y³ | 2/3 | x^{2/3} | x^{2/3−ε} | ❌ "not quite met" | **x^ε** |
| x² + 1 | **1/2** | x^{1/2} | x^{1/2}(log x)^{−222} | ❌ | **x^{1/6}** |

Heath-Brown's workaround closed a gap of ε. For x² + 1 the gap is a sixth of an
exponent. Nothing in [HB] suggests a bespoke sieve could absorb that, and his
own remark is scoped to "our application".

### The revised priority

The previous version of this note concluded "the obstruction is Type I, not
Type II" and deprioritised Step 2. That reordering was premature. The accurate
statement is:

- **(R1)'s x^{2/3} is soft** — precedent exists for relaxing it, and it is a
  hypothesis of one theorem.
- **κ = 1 is hard.** [Note F](note-F-failure-localisation.md)'s C₄-free lemma is
  a theorem about the sequence, not a hypothesis of a sieve. It survives any
  change of sieve, and at α = 1/2 it says the Type II incidence structure
  degenerates to a forest. [HB] independently stresses that the Type II bound,
  not the sieve procedure, is "the most novel part" of his proof.

**So Step 2 is the right half after all.** What Note C establishes is narrower
than last stated: ASP *as written* does not apply, and the reason is (R1) — but
(R1) is the negotiable hypothesis and Type II is where the difficulty lives.

### What is available at α = 1/2

Iwaniec, *Invent. Math.* **47** (1978), 171–188, remains the record: for
irreducible g(n) = an² + bn + c with a > 0 and c odd (so x² + 1 qualifies),
g(n) = P₂ infinitely often, with |{n ≤ x : g(n) = P₂}| ≫ Γ_g x/log x. That is a
**lower-bound weighted sieve** (Richert's weighted sum), not an asymptotic —
i.e. exactly the parity-limited conclusion. The gap between that and the
theorem is precisely the parity barrier, and ASP is the only machine built to
cross it. *(Read via an exposition, not the original — see
[refs/bibliography.md](../refs/bibliography.md).)*

## The hypotheses, quoted

Sequence A = (aₙ) of nonnegative reals, A(x) = Σ_{n≤x} aₙ,
A_d(x) = Σ_{n≤x, d|n} aₙ = g(d)A(x) + r_d(x). Goal: an asymptotic for
S(x) = Σ_{n≤x} aₙΛ(n).

### Standing conditions

| eq. | statement | p. | holds for x²+1? |
|---|---|---|---|
| (1.4) | A(x) ≫ A(√x)(log x)² | 1041 | ✅ x^{1/2} ≫ x^{1/4}(log x)² |
| (1.6) | A_d(x) ≪ d^{−1}τ(d)⁸A(x) uniformly in d ≤ x^{1/3} | 1042 | ✅ ρ(d) ≤ τ(d) |
| (1.8) | 0 ≤ g(p) < 1, g(p) ≪ p^{−1} | 1042 | ✅ g(p) = ρ(p)/p ∈ {0, 2/p} |
| (1.9) | Σ_{p≤y} g(p) = log log y + c + O((log y)^{−10}) | 1042 | ✅ PNT mod 4 |
| (1.16) | aₙ = 0 if μ(n) = 0 | 1044 | ❌ x²+1 is often non-squarefree (7²+1 = 2·5²) |

### Hypothesis (R) — Type I

> **(R)** Σ_{d≤D} μ²(d)|r_d(t)| ≤ A(x)(log x)^{−222} for all t ≤ x, with
> **(R1)** x^{2/3} < D(x) < x.  *(p. 1043)*

- **θ₁ = 2/3**, strictly. Not a convenience: (R1) is a lower bound on D.
- Log-saving exponent **E = 222**.
- Only squarefree moduli are summed.

### Hypothesis (B) — Type II

> **(B)** Σ_m | Σ_{N<n≤2N, mn≤x} γ(n)μ(mn)a_{mn} | ≤ A(x)(log x)^{−222}
>
> for every N with **(B1)** Δ^{−1}√D < N < δ^{−1}√x, some δ = δ(x) ≥ 2,
> Δ = Δ(x) ≥ 2, where **(B2)** γ(n) = γ(n,C) = Σ_{d|n, d≤C} μ(d), required for
> every C with **(B3)** 1 ≤ C ≤ xD^{−1}.  *(pp. 1043–1044)*

Answering the questions the skeleton left open:

- **Is α_m arbitrary?** Effectively yes — the absolute value sits outside the
  m-sum, which is the sup over |α_m| ≤ 1. The repo's `mobius_bilinear` is the
  right measurement and `worst_case_signs` is not. ✅ as built.
- **Is β = μ?** Essentially. The inner coefficient is γ(n)μ(mn), a
  Möbius-type weight with a short divisor truncation, not an adversary. ✅
- **Range of N:** √D up to √x, up to the Δ, δ factors.

### Conclusion delivered

> **Theorem 1** *(p. 1044)*. Σ_{p≤x} a_p log p = HA(x){1 + O(log δ / log Δ)},
> with H = Π_p (1 − g(p))(1 − 1/p)^{−1}.

An **asymptotic**, not a lower bound. "In practice (B) can be established … for
δ = (log x)^α and Δ = x^η", giving error O(log log x / log x).

### Theorem 2 — the non-squarefree version

Since x² + 1 violates (1.16), §9 is the relevant version. It replaces (1.16) by
(9.1) and adds *(p. 1059)*:

> **(9.2)** Σ_{n≤x} aₙ² ≤ x^{−2/3}A(x)², or the weaker sufficient
> **(9.3)** Σ_{n≤x} aₙ² ≤ x^{−1}A(x)²D(x)^{1/2};
> **(R3)** Σ³_{d<DL²} |r_d(t)| ≤ A(x)L^{−2}, L = (log x)^{224}, cubefree moduli.

> **Theorem 2** *(p. 1059)*. Assume (1.4), (1.6), (1.8), (1.9), (B), (B1),
> (B2), (B3), (9.1), (9.2), (R3), (R1). Then (1.17) holds.

**[X2Y4]** §2 (pp. 953–954) restates this applied form: (2.9) with
**(2.10) x^{2/3} < D < x**, and the bilinear hypothesis (2.11) over
**(2.14) Δ^{−1}√D < N < δ^{−1}√x**.

---

## Verification against A = {x² + 1}

Take aₙ = #{m ≥ 1 : m² + 1 = n}, so aₙ ∈ {0,1} and A(x) = ⌊√(x−1)⌋ ≍ x^{1/2}.
Note A's ρ(d) is exactly [X2Y4]'s ρ(d), and g(d) = ρ(d)/d.

**Three independent failures, all the same fact.**

1. **(R) + (R1).** Note B: Σ_{d≤D}|r_d| ≍ D, so (R) needs D ≪ x^{1/2}(log x)^{−222}.
   (R1) needs D > x^{2/3}. **Empty.**
2. **(9.2).** LHS = Σ aₙ² = A(x) = x^{1/2}. RHS = x^{−2/3}A(x)² = x^{1/3}.
   Needs x^{1/2} ≤ x^{1/3}. **False.**
3. **(9.3), the weaker fallback.** RHS = x^{−1}·x·D^{1/2} = D^{1/2}. Needs
   D ≥ x, contradicting (R1)'s D < x — and a fortiori D ≤ x^{1/2}. **False.**

Every one traces to A(x) = x^{1/2} < x^{2/3}. This is not a normalisation
artefact and not repairable by reformulating: the set of Gaussian integers on
Im z = 1 with norm ≤ x has x^{1/2} elements, and there is no denser
presentation of the same problem to sift instead.

## What this does to the Type II picture

Even waiving (R1) and taking the largest conceivable D = x^{1/2}, (B1) would
require N ∈ (x^{1/4}, x^{1/2}) up to δ, Δ, i.e. **M = x/N ∈ (x^{1/2}, x^{3/4})**.
In the repo's variables (X = √x = |A|) that is **M ∈ (X, X^{3/2})** — and
[Note H](note-H-numerical-pilot.md) measured, at X = 2×10⁴:

| M range | S_μ | A(x) = X | S_μ / A(x) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| [10⁴, 10⁵) | 18 519 | 20 000 | 0.93 |
| [10⁵, 10⁶) | 20 058 | 20 000 | 1.00 |
| [10⁶, 10⁷) | 20 273 | 20 000 | 1.01 |

**No saving whatever, where (B) demands a factor (log x)^{−222}.** The
cancellation Note H found (≍ √(MX), θ < 1) lives at M < X — *outside* the
range the sieve needs. So Note H's earlier reading ("the obstruction looks
technical rather than structural") was measuring the wrong window and has been
corrected.

The reason is structural and is the same κ of [Note F](note-F-failure-localisation.md):
(B1) forces N ≤ √x, hence M ≥ √x; cancellation in the m-sum needs m to divide
more than one element of A, i.e. M ≤ A(x). Both hold at once **iff
A(x) > √x, i.e. iff κ = A(x)²/x > 1** — and for x²+1, κ = 1, so the two
constraints meet only at the single point M = A(x). The invariant derived in
Note F turns out to be exactly the condition for (B1)'s range to be
non-degenerate. That was not built in; it is a genuine consistency check.

## Consequences for the plan

The plan's §1.5 checkpoint asks Note C for "a precise bilinear inequality whose
proof would imply the theorem via the asymptotic sieve". Strictly, **no such
inequality exists for [ASP] as written** — (R1) is unsatisfiable, so no Type II
input can invoke Theorem 1 or Theorem 2. But that is a statement about one
theorem's hypotheses, and [HB] is the precedent for replacing them.

- **Step 2 stands.** [Note F](note-F-failure-localisation.md)'s Question F is
  still the right target: it is a statement about the sequence, and it does not
  depend on which sieve consumes it. Notes E, F, G, H are not downstream of a
  dead end.
- **What Step 1 delivers is a constraint, not a checkpoint.** Any sieve applied
  to x² + 1 must run on a Type I level of x^{1/2}, which is a sixth of an
  exponent below what [ASP] asks. Note C's deliverable is therefore that
  constraint plus the evidence that (R1) is soft — not the bilinear inequality
  the plan expected.
- **The plan's §1.3.2 prediction was right.** The Type I level really is
  x^{1/2−ε}, by the sharp argument of Note B.

## Open

- **[VERIFY]** Where in [ASP] §§3–8 is x^{2/3} actually used, and how far down
  does [HB]'s "seems possible that (R1) might be relaxed" actually go? He needed
  ε; we need 1/6. Reading [HB] §§2–3 against [ASP] §§3–8 is the concrete task.
- **[VERIFY]** Does any post-2001 work state an asymptotic sieve for primes with
  a Type I requirement below x^{2/3}? The scan has not been run properly.
  Candidates spotted and unread:
  [arXiv:2111.04136](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04136) (prime values of
  f(a,b²)), [arXiv:2112.03617](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03617) (X²+(Y²+1)²
  — note the inner y²+1), [arXiv:2407.14368](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14368)
  (theory of prime-producing sieves).
- **Settled, no longer open.** Heath-Brown's relation to [ASP] (he does not use
  it, and says why); x³+2y³'s position at the boundary; that a² + b⁴ attains
  D = A(x)^{1−ε}.

## Adversarial review

- *Two-parameter freedom smuggled in?* No — this note only reads hypotheses.
- *Where is parity broken?* In [ASP] by hypothesis (B); §1 is explicit that (B)
  is the new axiom and (R) the classical one. The finding here is that x²+1
  fails the *classical* half, so it never reaches the parity-breaking machinery.
- *Is the failure really unfixable, or an artefact of choosing aₙ as an
  indicator?* Weighting cannot help: (9.2) compares Σaₙ² to A(x)², and any
  reweighting that inflates A(x) inflates Σaₙ² at least as fast by
  Cauchy–Schwarz. Worth writing out properly.
- *Could a different sieve apply?* Yes — [ASP] is one theorem, not a proof of
  impossibility, and [HB] is the worked precedent for writing a replacement when
  (R1) fails. Iwaniec 1978 (P₂) already works at this density with a classical
  weighted sieve; what is unavailable at A(x) = x^{1/2} is the parity-breaking
  upgrade.
- *Did this note over-read its own finding once already?* Yes. The first version
  concluded "the obstruction is Type I, not Type II" and deprioritised Step 2.
  Heath-Brown's p. 3 remark shows (R1) is the negotiable hypothesis. The lesson
  is to distinguish **a hypothesis of one theorem** from **a property of the
  sequence**: Note B's x^{1/2} cap and Note F's C₄-free lemma are the latter and
  survive any change of sieve; (R1) is the former.
